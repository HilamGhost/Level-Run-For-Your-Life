<h1>REALISTIC BACKROOMS LEVEL ! ADVENTURE</h1>

Level ! consists of a long hallway, approximately ten kilometers in length, with its structure resembling that of a hospital. The hallway has several doors, each one approximately three meters from each other. There are also bright, flickering exit signs for the entirety of the level, each one about ten meters from each other.
 
 The entities will adapt to one's capacity of running, to a point of giving difficulty even to the ones experienced at running. The further one goes, the less the entities will become, however the only few ones left will be even more aggressive than before. It has been reported that different people can be in Level ! at the same time, however one will never meet another. It's presumed the level will create a copy for each person that is in, so there's no way to be with someone else inside the level.

<h1>YOU MUST WALK 10 KILOMETER FOR ESCAPE THIS LEVEL</h1>
<pre>

Our goal is the run the 10 kilometers while “Smiler” chasing us. Press “Space” for vaulting. After that you can finish the game.

All assets are game-ready assets.

My first goal is making a portolio and show my coding style.

<h2> Tips for Developers </h2>

I used Singleton.

I know I didn't use comments too much, this was my mistake sorry.
